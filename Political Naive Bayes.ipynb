On the left hand side are the features and on the left are the ratio of republican to democratic or vice versa. So, for the first row where the word \"china\" is in the text, the odds are that the text belongs to a Republican party member 27.1 to 1. Interestingly enough, all the words I would associate with a republican party post/speech is reflected in the results. It is also interesting that most of the results, the classifier assigned to Republican. It makes me think that this is a classifier that's 50/50, where it just randomly assigns the words with the party.  \n",

Because the text varies so much and some tokens can be used for both parties, the classifier made the decision to lean heavily on democrativ as the party. I've also noticed that the token \"http\" or \"https\" was in each excerpt regardless of whether the person speaking is Republican or Democratic. The next step to improving this model would be to remove these tokens from each text."
