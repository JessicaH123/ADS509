Hozier Lyrics




"In The Woods Somewhere"



My head was warm
My skin was soaked
I called your name
'Til the fever broke

When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black
That the darkness hums

I raised myself
My legs were weak
I prayed my mind
Be good to me

An awful noise
Filled the air
I heard a scream
In the woods somewhere

A woman's voice
I quickly ran
Into the trees
With empty hands

A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no word
No sound he made

His bone exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone
To end his pain

What caused the wound?
How large the teeth?
I saw new eyes
Were watching me

The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life
I didn't have

Deer in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers
Of joining you

I clutched my life
And wished it kept
My dearest love
I'm not done yet

How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something
In the woods somewhere
